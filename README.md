# Interactive Sales Dashboard of AdventureWorks Company

## Project Introduction:


In this project, I am helping the AdventureWorks Company transform their static internet sales reports into an interactive, visual dashboard. The goal is to provide a clearer, more dynamic view of their sales performance. The dashboard focuses on key business metrics such as product sales, customer purchasing behavior, and sales trends over time. By leveraging SQL for data cleaning and Power BI for dashboard creation, this project aims to deliver actionable insights that enable better decision-making and more efficient sales strategies.

## Dataset Description: Microsoft AdventureWorksDW2022:

The **Microsoft AdventureWorksDW2022** dataset is a comprehensive sample database designed for demonstrating business intelligence, data warehousing, and analytics solutions. It represents a fictional bicycle manufacturer called AdventureWorks, with data spanning across various business operations such as sales, products, customers, and more.

The dataset includes detailed sales data, allowing for in-depth analysis of product sales, customer demographics, regional performance, and sales trends over time. It contains tables such as FactInternetSales, DimProduct, DimCustomer, and DimDate, which are essential for performing sales analysis, customer segmentation, and time-based trends.

This rich dataset is ideal for building dashboards that offer insights into business performance, helping decision-makers understand which products are selling, who the customers are, and how sales are evolving over time.
