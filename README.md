# Interactive Sales Dashboard of AdventureWorks Company

## Project Introduction:


In this project, I am helping the AdventureWorks Company transform their static internet sales reports into an interactive, visual dashboard. The goal is to provide a clearer, more dynamic view of their sales performance. The dashboard focuses on key business metrics such as product sales, customer purchasing behavior, and sales trends over time. By leveraging SQL for data cleaning and Power BI for dashboard creation, this project aims to deliver actionable insights that enable better decision-making and more efficient sales strategies.

## Dataset Description: Microsoft AdventureWorksDW2022:

The **Microsoft AdventureWorksDW2022** dataset is a comprehensive sample database designed for demonstrating business intelligence, data warehousing, and analytics solutions. It represents a fictional bicycle manufacturer called AdventureWorks, with data spanning across various business operations such as sales, products, customers, and more.

The dataset includes detailed sales data, allowing for in-depth analysis of product sales, customer demographics, regional performance, and sales trends over time. It contains tables such as FactInternetSales, DimProduct, DimCustomer, and DimDate, which are essential for performing sales analysis, customer segmentation, and time-based trends.

This rich dataset is ideal for building dashboards that offer insights into business performance, helping decision-makers understand which products are selling, who the customers are, and how sales are evolving over time.

## Client Request and Project Scope:

The client, AdventureWorks, aims to **improve their current internet sales reports by moving from static reports to dynamic, interactive dashboards**. The focus of this project is to create **a dashboard that visually presents how much they have sold, which products were sold to which customers**, and how sales have trended over time. Additionally, the **client has provided a budget spreadsheet for 2024, and they want to compare actual sales performance against this budget**.

**The analysis will consider sales data from the past two years to provide a historical context and identify trends**. The final dashboard will deliver key insights, helping the client understand product performance, customer behaviors, and whether sales are aligning with their projected budget for 2024.
